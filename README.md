# Daily Weather Forecast 🌦️
- Daily Weather Forecast is a simple weather application that provides real-time weather updates using a **public weather API**.
- This project was built to practice working with public APIs and understand how they function.  

## 🚀 Live Demo  
- You can access the deployed version here:  
👉 [Daily Weather Forecast](https://daily-weatherforecast.onrender.com/)  

## 📌 Important Notice  
- This app **uses a free API key**, which comes with a **limited number of requests per day**.  
- If the app **does not respond** or returns an empty response, it is likely due to the **API limit being reached** or the **API key being expired**.  
- Please be patient, as sometimes the API response may take longer than expected.
