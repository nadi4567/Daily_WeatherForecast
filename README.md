# Daily_WeatherForecast
It can forecast the current weather condition and other situations.I created this to practise usage Public ApI and how they works. 
It might be no response due to TOO MANY REQUEST . It is because that I used my API key for free. It only get specific limits per day.

To clone my repo => git clone https://github.com/nadi4567/

To start , run => node index.js

Here's my app, I deployed on render.com => https://daily-weatherforecast.onrender.com/

WARNING   ====> There's a warning which is that it can take some times to weather response to you from time to time cuz of the limit of weather API I used.
If you got nothing , this is no because of code error , it just because of the API limit of may be API key expired.
